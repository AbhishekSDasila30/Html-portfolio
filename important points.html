            <ul>
                <li>Browsers do not allow accessing local files via absolute paths for security reasons, especially when opened in a browser (e.g., Chrome, Edge).

                    âœ… Solution:
                    Use a relative path to the image file
                </li>
                <li><b>ABSOLUTE FILE PATH </B>: THE FILE PATH THAT IS RELATED TO ROOT DIRECTORY </LI>
                <LI> <B>RELATIVE FILE PATH </b> : It is relative to some directory usally shorter. In web development relative file path is more important </li>
